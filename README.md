#Welcome to the Swift Algorithms!

Here you'll find implementations of popular algorithms and data structures in everyone's favorite new language Swift, with detailed explanations of how they work. 

If you're a computer science student who needs to learn this stuff for exams -- or if you're a self-taught programmer who wants to brush up on the theory behind your craft -- you've come to the right place

The goal of this project is to **explain how algorithms work**. The focus is on clarity and readability of the code, not on making a reusable library that you can drop into your own projects. That said, most of the code should be ready for production use but you may need to tweak it to fit into your codebase.

Code is compatible with **Xcode 10** and **Swift 4.2**. We'll keep this updated with latest version of Swift. If you're interested in a Github pages version of the repo, check out [this](link).

##Important links

[What are algorithms and data structures?](What%20are%20Algorithms.md) Pancakes!

[Why learn algorithms?](Why%20Algorithms.md) Worried tis isn't your cup of tea? Then read this.

[Big-O notation](Big-O%20Notation.md). We often say things like, "This algorithm is **O(n)**." If you don't know what that means. read this first.
